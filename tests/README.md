# Testing

This directory will contain automated testing harnesses:
- `integration/` — end-to-end validation of call flows, knowledge base responses, and failure recovery.
- `load/` — SIPp scenarios and LiveKit simulators for concurrency testing.

Each subdirectory will expose CLI entrypoints for CI usage and documentation for running locally.
