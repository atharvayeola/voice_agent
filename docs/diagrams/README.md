# Diagrams

Diagrams authored with Mermaid markdown:

- `docs/diagrams/system_architecture.mmd` — High-level component layout (telephony ingress, media fabric, AI services, observability).
- `docs/diagrams/call_flow_sequence.mmd` — End-to-end media and control sequence for a PSTN caller.
- `docs/diagrams/scaling_plan.mmd` — Autoscaling topology across ingress, media, agent workers, and observability.

Render with a Mermaid-compatible viewer (VS Code Mermaid extension or `mmdc`) when preparing documentation exports.
